          My story begins 25 years ago. A creative boy who loves to build legos and play in the dirt.
          I love the fresh salty air by the beach and the brisk chills of the north. My curious mind 
          taught me to explore, and think critically.

          Technology is thrilling. AI, Web3, VR, and the fast moving industry excites me.

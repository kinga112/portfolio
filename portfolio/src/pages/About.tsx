          My story begins 25 years ago. A creative boy who loves to build legos and play in the dirt.
          I love the fresh salty air by the beach and the brisk chills of the north. My curious mind 
          taught me to explore, and think critically.

          Technology is thrilling. AI, Web3, VR, and the fast moving industry excites me. 
          Which is why I fell in love with it! I am happy to have started my journey early
          taking a AP computer science course at MIT, which mostly taught Java
